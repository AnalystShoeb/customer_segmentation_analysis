Customer Segmentation Analysis
This repository contains the code and analysis for a customer segmentation project using data related to customer demographics and financial attributes. The goal of the project was to identify distinct customer segments based on various attributes, which could be valuable for targeted marketing strategies.

Project Overview
The project involved:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Standardizing and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Dimensionality Reduction: Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining key patterns.
Clustering: Identifying customer segments using unsupervised learning techniques (e.g., k-means clustering).
Segmentation Analysis: Grouping customers into four distinct clusters based on demographic and financial factors.
Data Used
The dataset includes the following key columns:

Age
Education
Years Employed
Income
Card Debt
Other Debt
Debt-to-Income Ratio
Behavioral Data
(Note: 'Purchase History' was excluded from the analysis.)

Key Findings
After analyzing the data, four distinct customer clusters were identified:

Cluster 1: Younger customers with moderate income and lower debt-to-income ratios.
Cluster 2: Highly educated, higher-income customers with significant debts.
Cluster 3: Middle-aged customers with stable employment and low debt.
Cluster 4: Older customers with substantial debt but high-income levels.
Each segment's key attributes, such as average age, income, education level, and debt profile, were analyzed in detail.

Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis, preprocessing, and clustering (Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.).
Tableau: For visualizing customer segments.
Jupyter Notebook: For running the code and presenting the analysis.
