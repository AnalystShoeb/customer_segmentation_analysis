- **Category 1: Income Distribution and Segmentation** 
- **Category 2: Debt Management Across Segments** 
- **Category 3: Targeted Strategies for Age Groups** 
- **Category 4: Employment and Financial Stability Trends** 

The Python was used to for this segmentation analysis can be found here [link](https://github.com/AnalystShoeb/customer_segmentation_analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Segmentation%20Analysis.ipynb).
An interactive Tableau dashboard used to report and explore sales trends can be found here [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shoebur.rahman/viz/CutomerSegmetationDashboard/CutomerSegmentationDashboard?publish=yes).

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The companies main database structure as seen below consists of three tables: Demographics Table, Income and Debt Table, and Cluster Assignments. A description of each table is as follows:
- **Demographics Table:** Contains details about customer age, education, and employment.
- **Income and Debt Table:** Includes income, card debt, and other debt levels for each customer.
- **Cluster Assignments:** Python library K-Mean was used to develop the Customer Segmentation Table.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
